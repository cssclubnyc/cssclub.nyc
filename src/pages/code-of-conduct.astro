    <h1>Code of Conduct</h1>
    <p>
      We are committed to providing a friendly, safe, and welcoming experience
      for everyone. All attendees, speakers, sponsors, and volunteers at CSS
      Club NYC are required to agree with the following code of conduct. We will
      enforce this code throughout the meetup, in any meetup-related activities,
      and in any CSS Club chats, social media, and Github repositories.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>We do not tolerate harassment of any sort</strong>. Harassment
      includes–but is not limited to–offensive comments related to gender,
      gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability,
      physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion, or technology
      choices, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing
      photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events,
      inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention, sexual
      language and imagery in talks and chat threads.

      Anyone violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled without a
      refund at the discretion of the conference organizers.
