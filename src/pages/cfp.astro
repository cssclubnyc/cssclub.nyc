    <h1>Speak at CSS Club NYC</h1>
    <p>
      For this event to be a success, we need you. We want to have engaging, fun
      talks from the widest range of voices possible. Whether this is your 100th
      time speaking in front of people or your first, CSS Club NYC is for you.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you've never given a talk, we highly encourage you to submit a talk.
      This is a fun, welcoming event and perfect for first time speakers.
    </p>
    <p>Talks...</p>
    <ul>
      <li>are up to 15 minutes long</li>
      <li>are about any CSS or CSS-related topic</li>
      <li>
        can be about new CSS features like view transitions, scroll animations,
        scoping, etc.
      </li>
      <li>can be about HTML, JavaScript, accessibility, etc.</li>
      <li>
        don't have to be specifically about code. They can be about a Design
        process or technique, how you or your team work together, etc.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <strong>The most important part of any talk is your viewpoint.</strong> Your
      talk doesn't have to be about a topic no one else has ever covered. What's
      most interesting and helpful to others is hearing about your unique point of
      view and experience with the topic.
    </p>
