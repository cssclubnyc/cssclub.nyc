I see the greatest CSS tips from the greatest CSS developers and I feel like I don't know anything at all. I decided to change that. No, I didn't go and “learn” CSS by reading MDN or some other high quality resource. I started a podcast with a bonafide CSS expert, Adam Argyle, and invited several others as guests. And what did I learn? Even they feel like they're bad at CSS. So in this talk we're all going to come together as a sort of festivus, airing out our grievances of being bad at CSS. And just maybe we all might learn a little along the way.",
