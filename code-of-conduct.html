        <h1>Code of Conduct</h1>
        <p>
          We are committed to providing a friendly, safe, and welcoming
          experience for everyone. All attendees, speakers, sponsors, and
          volunteers at CSS Club NYC are required to agree with the following
          code of conduct. We will enforce this code throughout the meetup, in
          any meetup-related activities, and in any CSS Club chats, social
          media, and Github repositories.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>We do not tolerate harassment of any sort</strong>. Harassment
          includes–but is not limited to–offensive comments related to gender,
          gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability,
          physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion, or
          technology choices, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following,
          harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or
          other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual
          attention, sexual language and imagery in talks and chat threads.
        </p>

        <p>
          Anyone violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled without a
          refund at the discretion of the conference organizers.
